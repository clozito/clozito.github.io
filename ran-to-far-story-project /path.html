                 <p>You start to walk on this dirt-covered path and by the time you realize it this nice beautiful day turns into a storm.</p>



                 <p> Raindrops start hitting your paws. Right, when you think this day can't get any worse it starts pouring rain. That dirt path you were walking on turns into a muddy mess. You start running to look for any place that might have some dry shelter.</p>
                 <p>In the distance, you notice a cave that looks dry and warm but you also could keep on running hoping your will run into your Mom and Carla!</p>
